Installation Instructions for OpenSHMEM
=======================================

The OpenSHMEM library currently installs on top of GASNet and anything
required by whichever conduit you want to use with GASNet, e.g. an
MPI.  GASNet provides a portable communications layer for this
implementation of OpenSHMEM to work on top of.

Package Requirements on Linux Distributions
===========================================

Common
======

    * gcc, g++, gfortran
    * git
    * make, bison, flex
    * m4
    * autoconf, automake
    * libtool, libtool-ltdl
    * environment-modules [optional]

Ubuntu
======

Software can be installed on the command-line with apt-get, or via
package managers like synaptic and aptitude.

    * libelf-dev

and you will need to tell configure

    --with-libelf-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

Fedora
======

    * group install 'Development Tools'
    * elfutils-libelf-devel

Redhat/CentOS
=============

    * Same as Fedora

SUSE/OpenSUSE
=============

    * Same as Fedora


GASNet Versions
===============

Released versions of GASNet are tracked as they come out and tested
against this implementation.  The first version used was 1.14.0 and
new versions are tested upon release.

GASNet is now available from its source repository, which has also
been used for testing.

Building GASNet
===============

GASNet can be configured in many weird and wonderful ways.  Unless
you're working in a very particular environment, it is probably
easiest to allow GASNet to auto-detect network support and configure
discovered conduits.

A sample configuration that the OpenSHMEM library's author has used
is:

    1: 	  /path/to/gasnet-source-directory/configure \
    2: 	      --enable-segment-fast                  \
    3: 	      --disable-aligned-segments             \
    4: 	      --enable-throttle-poll                 \
    5:        --disable-udp                          \
    6:        --with-pmi=/path/to/pmi                \
    7: 	      --prefix=/path/to/install

This is for a general-purpose GNU/Linux system (or cluster):

    1:    path to configure script (build in separate directory)
    2: 	  "fast" (small messages) segment
    3: 	  address-space-randomization, heap addresses can be different
    4: 	  throttled polling for SMP conduit
    5:    don't bother building UDP support, don't want it here
    6:    integrate with the PMI infrastructure
          (e.g. "srun" in a SLURM installation or via "aprun")
    7: 	  where to install GASNet

Building OpenSHMEM
==================

Here is how configure might be called on a cluster using Infiniband,
with debugging support (e.g. argument and PE range checking) and
operation tracing:

    1:    .../configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
    2:                  --with-gasnet-root=/usr       \
    3:                  --with-gasnet-conduit=ibv     \
    4:                  --enable-debug		      \
    5:                  --enable-trace

On a cluster using gigabit as interconnect, or on a single SMP
machine:

    1:    .../configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM                 \
    2:                  --with-gasnet-root=/opt/gasnet/large \
    3:                  --with-gasnet-conduit=mpi

Optimized for SMP (no MPI involved):

    1:    .../configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
    2:                  --with-gasnet-root=/usr       \
    3:                  --with-gasnet-conduit=smp     \
    4: 	                --enable-throttle-poll        \
    5:                  --enable-debug

    (GASNet built with fast/large model)

Compilers and flags can be selected via environment variables, e.g.

    CC="gcc" CFLAGS="-g -O2" .../configure ...options...

The compiler suite can also be selected at one go via

    .../configure ... --with-compiler=SUITE

where SUITE is a name such as GNU, Intel, ... (case-insensitive).
Omitting the SUITE will list known compilers.

This library's configure script will list the discovered conduits for
you and prompt for a choice if you do not choose one explicitly; if
there is exactly 1 conduit available, it will be used automatically.


OpenSHMEM Installation Notes
============================

The "configure" script
======================

This script will eventually be the GNU autotools setup, but for now
it's just a basic shell script to give the same kind of look-and-feel.
The script accepts a --help option.

After configure has run successfully, it will leave a file
"config.status" in the top-level build directory containing the
information required to recreate the selected configuration.  The file
is executable, so you can just say

    ./config.status

to re-run the same configure.

The default layout of an installation is as follows:

.
|-- bin
|   |-- oshc++
|   |-- oshcc
|   |-- oshcxx
|   |-- oshfort
|   `-- oshrun
|-- include
|   |-- mpp
|   |   |-- pshmem.fh
|   |   |-- pshmem.h
|   |   |-- pshmemx.fh
|   |   |-- pshmemx.h
|   |   |-- shmem.fh
|   |   |-- shmem.h

        |   |-- oshcc.1
        |   |-- oshcxx.1
        |   |-- oshfort.1
        |   `-- oshrun.1
        |-- man3
        `-- man5


GASNet & Infiniband
-------------------

On some cluster setups we have seen issues with larger segment sizes.
Restricting the segment allocation to 512MB has solved these problems.
Note that you can do this via an environment variable supported by
this OpenSHMEM library: see the man page for oshconfig(5).  The kernel
parameters "shmmax" and "shmall" may affect this behavior.  Some notes
on setting these can be found here:

  http://www.puschitz.com/TuningLinuxForOracle.shtml#SettingSharedMemory

Other GASNet environment variables that may help include

  GASNET_PHYSMEM_NOPROBE
  GASNET_PHYSMEM_MAX
  GASNET_NUM_QPS

See the GASNet documentation for details:

  http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu/dist/vapi-conduit/README

(vapi and ibv are the same).

Update: the registered memory issues are at least partly due to
hardware not allowing large registrations by default.  We (UH) were
able to fix this on our development cluster by following the
instructions at:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-low-reg-mem

In situations where you want to be able to pass a hostfile or specific
arguments to MPI, GASNet provides an environment variable MPIRUN_CMD:

  http://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist/mpi-conduit/README

ELF Library
-----------

There are 2 common ELF libraries:

    elfutils :: https://fedorahosted.org/elfutils/
    libelf   :: http://www.mr511.de/software/english.html

While all local development (University of Houston) has used elfutils
on a number of Linux distributions, we encountered some portability
issues between elfutils and libelf on some remote systems.  Hopefully
these issues have been addressed.

N.B. we don't currently support other executable formats (Mach-O,
XCOFF etc.).

Module
======

The module(1) command

    http://modules.sourceforge.net/

allows users or sysadmins to simplify setting up extra packages.

A sample file will be created after configure is run and will be
installed to

    <install>/modulefiles/openshmem

You can then

    module load <install>/modulefiles/openshmem

to set up your environment for OpenSHMEM.  See the modules
documentation for more advanced usage.

Pkg-Config
==========

pkg-config(1)

    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config

helps packages provide configuration information for other packages to
interact with them, so you can ask OpenSHMEM for its CFLAGS or
libraries for linking.  Add

    <install>/lib/pkgconfig

to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.  The modulefile installed
as part of this library does that automatically.

This means you can compile/link programs e.g. with Open64 from a bash
shell (single line wrapped for formatting):

    $ opencc $(pkg-config --cflags openshmem)     \
          program.c                               \
              $(pkg-config --libs openshmem)

or with any other compiler of your choice (N.B. implementations on top
of some MPIs will require compilation in this manner with the
appropriate MPI compiler wrapper such as mpicc, or otherwise passing
the definitions, headers and libraries for that MPI to a compiler).
